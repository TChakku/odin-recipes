  <p>Steps</p>
  
  <p><ol>
    <li>Cook the noodles according to package instructions, then drain and rinse with cool water. I like to add a few ice cubes to the noodles while running cool water over them to help cool the noodles faster. Drain and add pasta to a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Add in the diced celery, red onion, red bell pepper, peas and cheese.</li>
    <li>Whisk together the dressing mayo, vinegar, sugar, mustard,pickle relish, salt and pepper in a small bowl until smooth and creamy.</li>
    <li>Pour the dressing into the large bowl and stir to coat evenly. Keep the salad covered and refrigerated until ready to serve. Enjoy!</li>
